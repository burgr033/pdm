# pdm

## Goals
  * [ ] Folder Management
    * [ ] Fast cloning support e.g. `pdm https://github.com/url`
    * [ ] Automatic Arranging of Projects due to context into separate folders in my Project root
    * [ ] Fast Project setup with my prefered folder structure (lightweight cookiecutter) e.g. `pdm create Peng --lang=go`
  * [ ] Indexing of Projects
    * [ ] Finding Projects (maybe with help of external tools like fzf)
    * [ ] Mass git status
  * [ ] OS agnostic (should work with the same features on linux and windows)
  * [ ] Prompt integration
  * [ ] fast cd into projects directory
    * [ ] fuzzy cd e.g. `pdm cd GoF` results in cd into `C:\_workspace\Projects\Go\FlashMe`
  * [ ] pinning projects to "favorites"
